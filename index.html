   <!-----The legacy-->
     <h2> The Legacy:</h2>
    <p>From the moment Ben found the <i>Omnitrix</i>, his world — and ours — was never the same. This alien DNA device fused the power of over <small>million</small> different species into the hands of an ordinary boy, turning him into the ultimate hero. Whether it’s the classic Heatblast, the unstoppable Four Arms, or the mind-bending XLR8, Ben’s transformations became iconic, showing us that even the most unlikely heroes have the power to save the world.</p>
<!------The evolution-->
    <h2>The Show’s Evolution:</h2>
    <p>What started as a simple, yet thrilling adventure turned into one of the most expansive universes in animated history. From Ben 10 (2005) through to Ben 10: Omniverse, we witnessed Ben grow from a boy with a super-powered watch into a true hero — facing new challenges, villains, and the weight of his power.

Ben 10 (Original Series): The beginning of it all — Ben’s accidental discovery of the Omnitrix and his first alien transformations.

Ben 10: Alien Force: A darker, more mature series where Ben evolves, learns the cost of his power, and becomes a leader.

Ben 10: Ultimate Alien: Enter the ultimate form of the Omnitrix, with Ben unlocking ultimate transformations and facing even greater threats.

Ben 10: Omniverse: A new chapter with a fresh style, introducing Ben's new partner Rook Blonko, diving deeper into the multiverse, and exploring alternate timelines and alien battles.</p>
<!------The Characters-->
<h2> The Characters:</h2>
<p>Ben’s journey wouldn’t be the same without <big>the friends and foes</big> that shaped his destiny:

Gwen Tennyson: Ben's cousin, magical powerhouse, and indispensable ally who helped keep him grounded.

Kevin Levin: The former villain turned anti-hero, always challenging Ben in the most unexpected ways.

Max Tennyson (Grandpa Max): The heart and mentor of the team, always guiding Ben through the toughest battles.

Vilgax, Khyber, Eon... The villains who challenged Ben to grow, becoming more than just a kid with a powerful watch.</p>
<!------The aliens-->

Ben 10 gave us classic transformations that became iconic in pop culture.

Ben 10: Omniverse introduced over 60 new aliens — including fan-favorites like Feedback, Ball Weevil, and Bloxx.

Every alien had its own strengths, weaknesses, and personality, making every transformation a unique battle.</p>

<h2>⚡ What Makes Ben 10 Great?</h2>

<u>The Growth of Ben Tennyson</u>: From a selfish kid to a true leader, Ben’s journey is one of personal sacrifice and responsibility.<br>

The Power of Friendship: No hero does it alone — Ben’s team of allies, including Gwen and Kevin, are just as integral to the fight as his alien transformations.<br>

Timelessness: Through the years, Ben 10 has evolved with its audience, staying relevant to both old fans and newcomers.<br>
